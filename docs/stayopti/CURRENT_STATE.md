# StayOpti Current State

Updated: 2026-08-17  
Status: last reported evidence-backed checkpoint, not a substitute for inspecting the repository

## Mandatory verification

Before any mutation, verify and report:

- repository path is the intended StayOpti repository;
- current branch and HEAD;
- `origin/main` relationship;
- staged, unstaged, and untracked state;
- canonical npm scripts and relevant tool versions;
- newest applicable Evidence artifact.

If repository reality differs from this file, stop and collect read-only evidence. Do not force the repository to match this document.

## Repository alignment after canonical-context installation

- repository `HEAD` immediately after the documentation-only canonical-context installation: `993da13330a96ef29cad8433b4a13a060dc6ed9a`;
- `origin/main` was aligned with that commit and the working tree was clean;
- the installation changed only `AGENTS.md` and `docs/stayopti/**`;
- no application code, dependencies, tests, or configuration files changed;
- the last functional V3-17BF checkpoint remains `12a39af8a5485ac92257fd8207282c6ae1c1810d`.

## Last functional checkpoint before context installation

The most recently accepted functional state reported in the working conversation is after V3-17BF, Golden Negative Outcome Baseline Binding:

- functional checkpoint commit: `12a39af8a5485ac92257fd8207282c6ae1c1810d`;
- Engine V2 canonical suite: `196/196 PASS`;
- Engine V3 suite: `360/360 PASS`;
- provider suite: `46/46 PASS`;
- lifecycle V2, typecheck, and build: PASS;
- working tree: reported clean;
- public baseline: V2 protected;
- V3: not public; promotion remains controlled and manual;
- split stay: not a substitute for an immature single-stay policy.

These values are historical assertions until revalidated locally.

## Program progress

- V3-00 through V3-16: reported complete in the integrated execution program.
- V3-17 Golden Decision Dataset work: active; numerous baseline cases and recovery cases have been executed.
- Multi-room prebook aggregation and failed-slot recovery underwent controlled repair and verification.
- Incorrect favorable-price/savings promotion, including behavior affecting Comfort and Maximum Comfort, was diagnosed and repaired.
- Negative-outcome and upstream failure accounting work reached V3-17BF.
- Dataset quality remains the objective: cases must contribute meaningful traveler decisions, not random test volume.

## Frozen direction

- V2 remains the public safety baseline.
- V3 remains offline/shadow until Golden Dataset, blind evaluation, calibration, robustness, fairness, abstention, and critical-regression gates are satisfied.
- No claim of V3 superiority or public readiness is valid from module count or test count alone.
- Public progression is `off → shadow → guarded-shadow → canary → public-eligible → manual authorization`.

## V3-17 Measurement Foundation Repair 001 — completed

Functional checkpoint: `0572b111fa4c98cfb16c32f9c6c294d6a1967155` (`feat(engine-v3): add measured decision foundation`). It was created from the verified `main` baseline `1a74be464bc56168d80a402663ad4a3bea103e5b`, which was aligned with `origin/main` and clean before implementation. Measurement Foundation Repair 001 is complete; the V3-17 audit verdict remains `GATE NOT MET`.

- The 115 existing Golden Receipts remain valid plumbing/binding evidence. They are not retroactively represented as decision-quality evidence.
- The five `decisionResearchUsable` cases remain useful research material, but they have not been blind-adjudicated and do not count as human or expert judgments.
- The Lisbon case cannot be retrofitted safely as Golden decision evidence because no complete replayable normalized snapshot was retained.
- Future real cases must use forward-only normalized source capsules with source hash, provenance, deterministic fingerprint and enough redacted evidence for offline replay.
- Blind review now supports `option-a`, `option-b`, `tie`, `no-good-option` and `insufficient-information` without requiring a role, engine, provider or original alternative order in the visible question. Role determination can occur only after a valid response.
- AI output is never counted as a human or expert judgment. Contract-test responses are explicitly technical, excluded from aggregation and leave the fixture `unmeasured`.
- External adversarial parents require an explicit canonical registry and exact case ID, content hash, dataset version and schema version; unresolved, ambiguous or altered references fail closed.
- This repair adds no real case and changes no V3-17 evidence count: Golden Receipts `115 → 115`, `decisionResearchUsable` `5 → 5`, eligible Golden cases `+0`, adversarial cases `+0`, counterfactual cases `+0`, human judgments `+0`, expert judgments `+0`.
- Validation on 2026-08-17: Engine V3 `370/370 PASS`; Engine V2 `196/196 PASS`; provider suite `46/46 PASS`; lifecycle V2 `122 PASS`, `17 SKIP`, `0 FAIL`; typecheck, build, repository-boundary checks and both Git diff checks PASS.
- Public V2 is protected and unchanged. V3 remains offline/shadow and non-public. SPLIT remains disabled. No provider or other external call, booking, payment or deployment occurred during implementation.

## Next-action rule

Determine the next package from the newest Evidence and repository state. Do not infer it only from an old alphabetical package label. After every accepted checkpoint, update this file with the exact commit, suites, evidence filename, external calls, and remaining blockers.
